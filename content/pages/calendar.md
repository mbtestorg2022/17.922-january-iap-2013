During the first week of class, we will get to know one another through reading, writing, class discussions, and videos. We'll learn some of the basics of the US Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King, and other leaders of this and other movements. There will be one small group project. We'll begin to brainstorm about concepts for the installation or the project.

During the second week, we will complete the small group projects, watch more videos and delve more deeply into some important issues and questions through readings, personal reflections, writing and small group discussions and exercises. By the end of this week, the group will develop individual and group concepts for the installation and projects.

During the first half of the third week, we will choose the main theme and designs for the installation and projects and organize the construction of the installation or the development of the projects. Working groups will be formed and all materials will be bought. During the second part of the third week, construction will begin.

The fourth week will be devoted to completing the building and producing of the installation and organizing the projects, designing the web page, and advertising the installation or project.
